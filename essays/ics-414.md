## ICS 414 Experience

Being a software engineer for the semester, working with people who I have never met before, and having to come up with solutions to our client's problems was all a first for me. This class provided me an experience that closely resemble what being a software engineer in the real world was like. Overall, I really enjoyed this class because of working with a team of people who all have such great ideas and features to keep developing the web application that fits the client's needs. This class taught me how to closely work with a team to continuously develop features to improve the financial web application. It also taught me a lot about the importance of communication within a team because sometimes there would be ideas one person could have but others in the group may not agree with and so we would have to discuss amongst ourselves about ways we could or could not implement the suggested feature.
