Season One
From as far back as I can remember, I have always loved playing Pokemon and became fascinated with creating my own games. So, when we were given creative assignments in elementary school, I would always take that opportunity to write my own spin-off version of Pokemon. I would stay in at recess to design my own Pokedex of Pokemons, gyms, rivals, and the entire map of what this world would look like. This was the introduction to the longest-running series ever made. Alongside designing my own Pokemon game, I became involved with my school's robotics team and was one of two coders on the robotics team. Endless hours would be spent designing the robot and creating code that allows this robot to function properly and this was the first time I ever coded anything! I fell in love with the process of it all and continued it into middle school.

Season Two
When I first heard that our middle school has a robotics club, I was more than thrilled to try it out! However, when I got there, it was not what I had expected. It was just a bunch of friends hanging out, building Lego-like kits, and having them do random things like pick up a pencil, race down the hallway, and do donuts around the classroom. Though there was no competitive aspect to this club, I quickly became fond of the free environment and allowed my creativity to run wild. I would often Frankenstein different codes together from the online library of actions the website had so my robot could do a series of tasks I wanted it to do. This was the first time I was able to freely work on robotic projects that I wanted to do, rather than meet competitive guidelines.

Season Three
Throughout all of this, I became really engrossed in gaming. Since high school, I made it my long-term goal to become a software engineer for Riot Games, which is the company that made my favorite game of all time, League of Legends. I became fascinated at the thought of being able to design cool champions, code them into the game, and be able to play those champions. Since then, I have taken high school classes that will take me a step closer to being able to work at Riot Games.

When came time to start college, I immediately knew I needed to major in Computer Science in order to become a software engineer. Keeping in mind that I want to work for a video game company in the future, I would need to start developing my own games and thankfully there is a game development club at UH Manoa that will help me get my foot through the door.

I hope to create more games throughout the remaining years of my academic career and continue to improve my coding and problem-solving skills.
