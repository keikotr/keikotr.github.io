## Déjà vu
As I walked on the warm, soft sand and dipped my toes in the water, it was not too cold or too hot but it felt rather comforting. I had experienced this before in another timeframe, it was another moment of deja vu. With only experience using Java and C/C++ - Javascript was nothing too short from home. At first, the thought of learning another programming language was rather nerve-racking but as I progressed through the tutorial, I found myself in a rather calm state, feeling that I found myself back in a familiar place.

## Learning Experience
What I learned was while Java is a very uptight language where missing variable types can completely halt your program, Javascript syntax rules are more loosey-goosey where variable typing is completely omitted! No variable typing quickly became my favorite part of Javascript as the only thing I needed to worry about was the accessibility of the data. A huge win in my books! However, I also noticed that Javascript has more relaxed rules than Java and it allows for more mistakes to be born. Thankfully, the majority of IDEs will tell me in real time if my program has syntax errors or any other errors that can be found during runtime.

## Upcoming Waves
As I continue to learn more and more about Javascript each day, I can envision using Javascript as my front-end language more often than ever in the present and for the future of my academic/personal career. I enjoy being able to get creative with how graphics and styling appear on my personal projects. While up until now, these design elements have only been visions, now with Javascript attached to my belt, I can bring my visions to life!
