As I walked on the warm, soft sand and dipped my toes in the water, it was not too cold or too hot but it felt rather comforting. I had experienced this before in another timeframe, it was another moment of deja vu. With only experience using Java and C/C++ - Javascript was nothing too short from home. At first, the thought of learning another programming language was rather nerve-racking but as I progressed through the tutorial, I found myself in a rather calm state, feeling that I found myself back in a familiar place.

While Java is a very uptight language where missing variable types can completely halt your program, Javascript syntax rules are more loosey-goosey where variable typing is completely omitted! No variable typing quickly became my favorite part of Javascript as the only thing I needed to worry about was the accessibility of the data. A huge win in my books! However, the relaxed rules of Javascript allows for more errors to be made but thankfully having experience with C/C++ where the console will not tell you in real time if your program has syntax errors or not minimizes the amount of errors that I could be potentially making since I became more attentive and cautious when creating programs.
