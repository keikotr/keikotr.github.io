This online iteration of Pig (the dice game) was for my ICS 111 class, which was an introductory class to coding, specifically in Java. This project was to recreate Pig (the dice game) inside of Java using Eclipse as an IDE with the following ruleset:
A player repeatedly rolls a pair of dice until a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
- If two 1s are rolled, the player's entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
- If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player with 100 or more points wins the game!

My role in this project was to write a program that complies with all the rules and incorporates loops, branching, and subroutines as that was the topic of focus for this project.
