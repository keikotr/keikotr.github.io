summary: "Creating Two-Dice Pig Game using Java for my ICS 111 class."
---
This online iteration of Pig (the dice game) was for my ICS 111 class, which was an introductory class to coding, specifically in Java. This project was to recreate Pig (the dice game) inside of Java using Eclipse as an IDE with the following ruleset:
A player repeatedly rolls a pair of dice until a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".
- If two 1s are rolled, the player's entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
- If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player with 100 or more points wins the game!

My role in this project was to write a program that complies with the rules of the game and to utilize different classes and objects in order to successfully create the game. This program was written by me with the help of the teaching assistants and class materials.

What I learned from this experience was how to take a problem, figure out the algorithm for that problem, and create code that implements the algorithm. Utilizing what I have been learning over the course of several months, I believe this was a great project that showcased my novice programming knowledge. This also taught me that you can create fun games even without a fancy user interface. As I went through the process of testing the game, my friend volunteered to play the game with me and we had a lot of fun despite the game only being in the console log.
